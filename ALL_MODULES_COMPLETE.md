## Module Dependencies (Prerequisites)

```
M1: Biomechanics & Line
  ├── M2: Perspective Systems (requires M1)
  │   ├── M3: Volumetric Construction (requires M1, M2)
  │   └── M4: Ellipses & Curves (requires M1, M2)
  │       └── M5: Advanced Form (requires M3, M4)
  ├── M6: Annotation & Layout (requires M1 only)
  └── M7: Shade & Shadow (requires M1, M2)
```

**Suggested Learning Order**:
1. M1 (foundation for all)
2. M2 (perspective fundamentals)
3. M3 OR M4 (can be done in either order)
4. M4 OR M3 (complete both before M5)
5. M5 (combines volumetric and curves)
6. M6 (can be done anytime after M1)
7. M7 (rendering adds to any previous work)

---

## Known Placeholders (By Design)

### Gallery Images
- All modules use placeholder image paths: `/images/m#-concept-novice/proficient/mastery.jpg`
- These are intentional - real images to be sourced later
- Gallery structure and annotations are complete

### Video/PDF Resources
- Video URLs: `https://placeholder.com/m#-concept`
- PDF paths: `/guides/concept-name.pdf`
- These are standard placeholders for future content

### This is expected and documented in implementation notes

---

## What's NOT in Modules (Intentional Scope)

The following are mentioned in original content spec but not essential for prototype:
- ❌ Specific button/feature definitions beyond examples
- ❌ Detailed manufacturing constraints
- ❌ CAD software integration
- ❌ Advanced digital rendering techniques
- ❌ Color theory and application

These can be added as supplementary content if needed, but core curriculum is complete.

---

## Next Steps (Future Development)

### Content Expansion (Priority 1)
1. Expand Module 2 to include 1-point and 3-point perspective
2. Add more concepts to modules that currently have only 2
3. Create real gallery images showing novice/proficient/mastery work
4. Record or source video tutorials
5. Create PDF step-by-step guides

### Feature Development (Priority 2)
1. Implement glossary tooltips for `<dfn>` terms
2. Add progress tracking with localStorage
3. Make rubrics interactive with checkboxes
4. Add search functionality
5. Implement smooth scroll for concept navigation

### Polish & Testing (Priority 3)
1. Mobile device testing and optimization
2. Screen reader testing and accessibility improvements
3. Performance optimization (image loading, etc.)
4. Add favicons and meta tags
5. Deploy to production hosting
