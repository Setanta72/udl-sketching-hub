modesOfExpression:
  physical: "Use a fineliner (0.1mm) for construction lines and a marker or (0.5mm) for profiles."
  digital: "Set your brush pressure sensitivity. Use a light blue color on a separate layer for construction lines."

commonErrors:
  - pitfall: "My lines are \"hairy\" or \"scratchy.\""
    diagnosis: "You are drawing from your wrist and \"sketching\" the line instead of \"drawing\" it."
    correction: "Lock your wrist. Practice the \"Line Gauntlet\" drill from your shoulder. Ghost the line 3 times, then draw it in one single, confident pass."
  - pitfall: "All my lines look the same; my drawing is flat."
    diagnosis: "You are not using line weight hierarchy."
    correction: "Re-draw an object _only_ focusing on weight. Go over your outline 3 times to make it the darkest."

## 1. Core Concepts

- **Drawing from Shoulder** (for large arcs/lines) vs. **Wrist** (for detail).

- **Stable Page Orientation:** Keeping your page fixed to build a consistent mental 3D model.

- **Line Confidence & Ghosting:** Rehearsing the stroke before drawing.

- **Line Weight Hierarchy** (5 types):

    1. **Construction:** (Lightest) The "scaffolding" you will draw over.

    2. **Internal:** Real edges _inside_ the form.

    3. **External:** Real edges on the _outside_ of the form.

    4. **Profile/Outline:** (Heaviest) The line that defines the object's silhouette.

    5. **Cut Lines:** (Heavy) Used for cross-sections.

## 6. Application

Sketch a simple, flat object (e.g., a credit card, a smartphone).

Your _only_ goal is to use at least 3 distinct line weights. Make the outline pop.

## 7. Mastery Rubric

### For Guided Path Learners:

- **Novice:** Lines are hairy, wobbly, and from the wrist.
- **Proficient:** Can use a ruler and different pens to create a clean drawing with a clear line weight hierarchy.
- **Mastery:** Can produce a "production-ready" technical drawing with perfect lines using aids.

### For Mastery Path Learners:

- **Novice:** Lines are hairy, wobbly, and from the wrist.
- **Proficient:** Lines are clean and from the shoulder. Some hierarchy is visible.
- **Mastery:** Freehand lines are crisp, confident, and show a deliberate and expressive 5-type hierarchy.
