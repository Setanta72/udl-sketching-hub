estimatedTime: "4-5 hours"
prerequisites: ["Module 1: Biomechanics & Line", "Module 2: Perspective Systems"]

learningObjectives:
  - "Understand ellipses as circles viewed in perspective"
  - "Apply the fundamental rule: minor axis aligns with cylinder axis"
  - "Draw smooth, confident ellipses without pinched corners"
  - "Construct accurate cylinders with parallel ellipses"
  - "Control ellipse degree based on viewing angle"

whyItMatters: "The majority of consumer products contain cylindrical forms: bottles, cans, wheels, knobs, tubes, handles. Poorly drawn ellipses instantly mark a sketch as amateur - they're the most common error in product sketching. Master ellipses and you'll be able to sketch water bottles, automotive wheels, industrial equipment, and any curved product with confidence and authority."

    title: "Ellipse Fundamentals & Axis Alignment"
    order: 1
    explanation: |
      An **ellipse** is simply a circle viewed in perspective. When you look at a circular wheel straight-on, it's a circle. Tilt it, and it becomes an ellipse.

      **Minor Axis** & **Major Axis**:
      - **Major Axis**: The longest diameter of the ellipse (widest dimension)
      - **Minor Axis**: The shortest diameter of the ellipse (narrowest dimension)
      - These axes are ALWAYS perpendicular to each other at the ellipse center

      **THE FUNDAMENTAL RULE**:
      The **minor axis** of an ellipse is ALWAYS aligned with the perspective axis (center line) of the cylinder or circular hole. This is not optional - it's geometric law.

      **Why This Matters**:
      - If you draw a cylinder and the minor axes don't align with the cylinder's center line, it looks "broken" or "rubbery"
      - This is the #1 error in ellipse drawing
      - Even if your ellipse shape is perfect, wrong axis alignment destroys the illusion

      **Ellipse Degree**: The "flatness" or "openness" of an ellipse. Determined by viewing angle:
      - Circle viewed straight-on = 90° (full circle)
      - Circle viewed at shallow angle = 10-20° (very flat ellipse)
      - Circle at mid angle = 45-60° (medium ellipse)

      **The Rule of Degree**: Ellipses on the same circular path in the same perspective MUST be the same degree. Example: both ends of a cylinder are identical ellipse degrees.

        difficulty: "beginner"
        scaffoldingSuggestion: "Use the X-method to find the square's center and mark the midpoint of each side. Draw the ellipse passing through these four points. Use an ellipse template afterward to check your accuracy."

      - title: "Minor Axis Check Drill"
        description: "Draw 5 cylinders in different orientations. For each, draw the center axis line FIRST, then draw ellipses with minor axes perpendicular to that line. Use a ruler to verify alignment."
        difficulty: "intermediate"
        scaffoldingSuggestion: "Draw the axis first in a different color (blue or red). Then draw your ellipses in black. Place a ruler along the minor axis of each ellipse - it should be exactly perpendicular to the axis line. If not, redraw."

      - title: "Degree Practice"
        description: "Draw a simple cylinder from 5 different eye levels: far above, slightly above, level, slightly below, far below. Observe how the ellipse degree changes. The middle view should be the flattest ellipse."
        difficulty: "intermediate"
        scaffoldingSuggestion: "Use the same cylinder size for all 5 views - only change your eye level. This isolates degree as the only variable. Draw horizon lines to show eye level for each view. Use ellipse templates to match your drawn ellipses and verify degree."

        description: "Fill a page with 50+ freehand ellipses of various sizes and degrees. Focus on smooth, continuous curves without lifting your pen. This is pure motor skill practice."
        difficulty: "beginner"
        scaffoldingSuggestion: "Ghost each ellipse 3-5 times before drawing. Don't aim for perfection - aim for smoothness and confidence. Draw fast enough that you can't overthink. After completing the page, circle your 5 best ellipses to build positive feedback."
        estimatedTime: "20 min"
    commonErrors:
      - errorTitle: "My ellipses look like footballs with pinched corners"
        description: "Ellipses have pointed ends instead of smooth, rounded curves throughout."
        diagnosis: "You're thinking of the ellipse as a 'pointy circle' and stopping at the tangent points. This creates the 'football' shape. You may also be drawing too slowly, which causes hesitation at the major axis endpoints."
        correction: "Think of the ellipse as a smooth, continuous oval with NO corners anywhere. Practice the ghosting motion focusing on roundness. Don't think about the square it fits in - think about the smooth, egg-shaped curve. Speed up slightly - fast ellipses are often smoother than slow ones because you can't overthink."
        whenToUseAids: "Use an ellipse template. Trace perfect ellipses to feel the correct motion in your muscle memory. Then practice freehand trying to replicate that smooth feeling. Ellipse templates are professional tools - not training wheels. Many designers use them for final work."
      - errorTitle: "My cylinders look broken or rubbery"
        description: "The cylinder appears to bend, twist, or not be solid. The two ends don't seem to line up properly."
        diagnosis: "Your ellipses' minor axes are not aligned. The two ellipses may be different degrees, or they're not perpendicular to the cylinder's center line. This is THE most common cylinder error."
        correction: "ALWAYS draw the cylinder's center axis line FIRST before any ellipses. Make it a strong, clear reference line. Then draw both ellipses ensuring their minor axes are perfectly perpendicular to this line. Use a ruler to check - place it along the minor axis of each ellipse. If it's not perpendicular to the center line, the cylinder will look wrong."
        whenToUseAids: "Draw the center axis with a ruler. Use an ellipse template to draw both ends - rotate the template to ensure the minor axis slots align perpendicular to your center line. Then practice freehand matching this setup. Digital: use the ellipse tool with rotation - rotate until the minor axis is perpendicular."
      - errorTitle: "My ellipses are lumpy and inconsistent"
        description: "Ellipses aren't smooth ovals - they have bulges or flat sections."
        diagnosis: "You're drawing too slowly and correcting as you go, or pivoting from your wrist instead of using full arm motion. Ellipses need fluid, confident execution."
        correction: "Draw ellipses from your shoulder with full arm rotation. Ghost 5-10 times until the motion is fluid. Then commit with a single confident pass. Draw fast enough that you can't make conscious corrections mid-stroke. It's okay to draw the ellipse 2-3 times on top of itself to build up a confident line - this is legitimate technique."
        whenToUseAids: "Practice with ellipse templates daily for 5 minutes - trace perfect ellipses to train motor memory. Use ellipse guides in digital apps. Physical: tape an ellipse template to your desk and trace it 50 times to build the muscle pattern. Then freehand next to it."
    physicalTips: "Buy a set of ellipse templates (Staedtler or similar) - they come in degrees from 10° to 60°. These are professional tools used by designers worldwide. For practice, use very light construction lines for the center axis and major/minor axis guidelines. Then draw the ellipse over them. Leave these guidelines visible to verify alignment. For presentation work, erase the guidelines. Draw ellipses fast - confident, swift motion produces better ellipses than slow, careful drawing."
    digitalTips: "Most apps have ellipse tools. Use them! Enable 'show rotation' to see the minor/major axis orientation. Rotate the ellipse until the minor axis is perpendicular to your cylinder axis. For practice, draw one ellipse with the tool, then try to match it freehand next to it. Enable symmetry guides set to 2-way symmetry - this forces your freehand ellipse to be symmetrical. Set brush stabilization low during practice so you feel the imperfections."

    title: "Cylinder Construction"
    order: 2
    explanation: |
      A **cylinder** is two parallel ellipses of identical degree connected by two straight tangent lines.

      **Construction Process**:
      1. Draw the cylinder's center axis line
      2. Draw two perpendicular cross-lines marking the ellipse centers
      3. Draw both ellipses with minor axes perpendicular to the center line
      4. Both ellipses must be the SAME degree (identical shape)
      5. Draw tangent lines connecting the ellipses at their widest points (major axis endpoints)

      **Critical Rules**:
      - The center axis connects the centers of both ellipses
      - Tangent lines are parallel to the center axis (they follow the same VP in perspective)
      - Both ellipses are identical in degree
      - The tangent lines touch the ellipses at the major axis endpoints ONLY

      **In Perspective**:
      When a cylinder is in perspective (angled), it follows your established VPs. The center axis converges to a VP. The tangent lines converge to the same VP. The ellipses' minor axes stay perpendicular to that center axis.

      **Cylinders on Ground Plane**:
      Multiple cylinders sitting on the same ground plane (like bottles on a table) will have increasing ellipse degrees as they get closer to eye level. Objects at eye level show the flattest ellipses.

        difficulty: "beginner"
        scaffoldingSuggestion: "Use a ruler for the center axis line. Use an ellipse template for the ellipse shapes. This builds understanding of the geometric relationship. Once you can do this accurately aided, practice the same thing freehand."

      - title: "Coin on Ground Plane"
        description: "Draw a perspective ground plane. Draw 10 circular 'coins' (ellipses) at various positions on this plane. Coins closer to horizon should be flatter ellipses; coins in foreground should be more open."
        difficulty: "intermediate"
        scaffoldingSuggestion: "Draw the horizon line first. Draw the ground plane in perspective. For each coin, its degree is determined by its distance from the horizon. Coins AT the horizon line would be completely flat (just a line)."

      - title: "Nested Cylinders"
        description: "Draw a cylinder, then draw a smaller cylinder inside it (like a can with a raised inner ring). Both share the same center axis. The inner cylinder's ellipses must align with the outer ones."
        difficulty: "advanced"
        scaffoldingSuggestion: "Draw the outer cylinder first following all rules. The inner cylinder shares the same axis and degree. Draw it smaller but maintain all geometric relationships. This tests precision in axis alignment."
        estimatedTime: "20 min"
    commonErrors:
      - errorTitle: "My cylinder looks like a cone or gets wider/narrower"
        description: "The two ellipse ends are not the same size, making it look tapered rather than cylindrical."
        diagnosis: "You drew ellipses of different sizes or different degrees. A true cylinder has identical ellipses at both ends. This is a very common error when drawing quickly."
        correction: "Mark both ellipse centers at the SAME distance from the center line. Use the same template degree for both ellipses, or freehand one ellipse, then very carefully match its size and degree for the second one. In perspective, both ellipses must follow the same degree rule even though they're at different depths."
        whenToUseAids: "Use the same ellipse template for both ends. Trace one ellipse, then use that exact same template slot for the other end. This guarantees identical degrees. Or use digital ellipse tool - copy/paste the ellipse to guarantee identical shapes."
      - errorTitle: "My tangent lines cut through the ellipse instead of touching it"
        description: "The straight sides of the cylinder intersect the ellipse curve instead of being tangent to it."
        diagnosis: "You're connecting the tangent lines to the wrong points. Tangent lines touch the ellipse at the major axis endpoints (the widest points) ONLY - not at random points on the curve."
        correction: "Mark the major axis endpoints on both ellipses first. These are the only points where the tangent lines should touch. Draw straight lines connecting these points. If using templates, some have marks showing the major axis endpoints - use these as connection points."
        whenToUseAids: "Use a ruler to draw the tangent lines. Place it precisely at the major axis endpoint of one ellipse and extend it to the corresponding endpoint of the other ellipse. The ruler helps ensure the line is straight and connects at the right points."
    physicalTips: "For glass objects or transparent cylinders, draw the full ellipse for both ends, including the hidden back part. This helps verify that both ellipses are identical and aligned. Then darken only the visible portions. Keep your ellipses light during construction - you can darken them after verifying everything aligns. Use line weight: ellipses closer to you are heavier, farther ones lighter."
    digitalTips: "Use a dedicated ellipse layer with a different color (like red or blue). Once verified correct, trace over it with final black lines on a new layer. Use the transform/rotate tool to ensure ellipses are at the correct angle - check that minor axis is perpendicular to your cylinder axis. Copy the first ellipse and paste it for the second end to guarantee identical shapes, then position it."

## Module Introduction

Ellipses are where beginner sketchers struggle most. They're also where professional quality becomes immediately visible. A sketch with perfect boxes but bad ellipses looks amateur. A sketch with loose boxes but confident ellipses looks professional.

**Why Ellipses Are Hard**: Your brain knows circles. It doesn't know ellipses. When you draw a tilted circle, your brain wants to "fix" it back to a circle. You have to train your hand to override this instinct and draw the correct elliptical shape.

**The Good News**: Ellipse drawing is pure motor skill. Unlike perspective (which requires spatial reasoning), ellipses just need practice. The rules are simple: smooth curves, minor axis alignment, consistent degree. That's it. 30 minutes of focused daily practice for 2 weeks will transform your ellipses.

**What You'll Master**: By the end of this module, you'll see cylinders everywhere. Water bottles, wheels, tubes, cans, handles - they're all cylinders. You'll understand that drawing a beer bottle is just: cylinder for the body, smaller cylinder for the neck, ellipse for the cap. Complex becomes simple.

**Critical Mindset**: Ellipses are forgiving. If your ellipse is slightly egg-shaped instead of perfectly symmetrical, but the axis is aligned correctly, it looks fine. If your ellipse is perfectly symmetrical but the axis is wrong, it looks broken. Prioritize axis alignment over perfect shape.
