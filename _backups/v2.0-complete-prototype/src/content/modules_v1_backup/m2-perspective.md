drills:
  - text: "**Drill:** Explicit Cube Studies in 1, 2 & 3-Point (Aided) - Use a ruler and on-page VPs."
    paths: ["guided"]
  - text: "**Drill:** The VP Transition Drill - Draw one cube aided, then one next to it freehand, aiming for the same VPs."
    paths: ["guided", "mastery"]
  - text: "**Drill:** \"Cubes in a Scene\" (Estimated) - Draw 10-15 cubes freehand, all obeying the same _implied_ VPs."
    paths: ["mastery"]
  - text: "**Drill:** Distortion Check - Draw cubes near the edge of your page to see how they distort."
    paths: ["guided", "mastery"]

modesOfExpression:
  physical: "Use a large sheet of paper (A3) to place VPs far apart. Use a T-square. Print perspective grids and trace over them."
  digital: "Use the \"Perspective Guide\" or \"Drawing Assist\" tool in your app (Procreate, Sketchbook, etc.)."

commonErrors:
  - pitfall: "\"My cubes look flat,\" or \"My parallel lines don't look right.\""
    diagnosis: "You are drawing in \"isometric\" (parallel lines) not \"perspective\" (converging lines)."
    correction: "Re-do the \"Explicit Cube Studies\" drill. Force _every_ receding line to go to a single VP."
  - pitfall: "\"My objects look weird or warped at the edges.\""
    diagnosis: "Your object is outside the Cone of Vision. Your VPs are too close together."
    correction: "Place your VPs _much_ further apart, ideally off the page."

## 1. Core Concepts

- **Horizon Line (HL):** Represents the viewer's eye level.

- **Vanishing Points (VP):** The points on the HL where parallel lines converge.

- **1, 2, and 3-Point Perspective.**

- <dfn>Cone of Vision (C.O.V.)</dfn>: The ~60° cone representing a distortion-free view.

- **Phase A (Explicit):** Placing VPs on your page.

- **Phase B (Gestural):** Estimating VPs off the page.

## 6. Application

Create a simple 'street view' scene.

- Draw an HL and two VPs.
- Sketch 3-5 'buildings' (as simple cubes) on the same ground plane.

## 7. Mastery Rubric

### For Guided Path Learners:

- **Novice:** Lines are parallel (isometric) or diverge. Relies 100% on VPs.
- **Proficient:** Can accurately construct complex scenes _using on-page VPs and rulers_.
- **Mastery:** Can rapidly produce complex, accurate drawings _using perspective grids or guides_.

### For Mastery Path Learners:

- **Novice:** Lines are parallel (isometric) or diverge. Relies 100% on VPs.
- **Proficient:** Can estimate simple forms freehand, but with some inconsistencies.
- **Mastery:** Intuitively sketches complex forms in accurate gestural 2-point perspective _without any guides_.
