    <h1>About Universal Design for Learning</h1>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>What is UDL?</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Universal Design for Learning (UDL)</strong> is an educational framework
        that provides flexibility in the ways information is presented, in the ways students
        respond or demonstrate knowledge and skills, and in the ways students are engaged.
      </p>

      <p>
        The UDL framework is based on three core principles:
      </p>

      <div class="udl-principles-detailed">
        <div class="principle">
          <h3>1. Multiple Means of Representation (The "What")</h3>
          <p>
            Learners differ in how they perceive and comprehend information. To reduce
            barriers to learning, it's important to provide information in multiple formats.

          <ul>
            <li>Video tutorials for visual learners</li>
            <li>Step-by-step text guides for those who prefer reading</li>
            <li>Image galleries showing examples</li>
            <li>Pop-up glossary terms for vocabulary support</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="principle">
          <h3>2. Multiple Means of Action & Expression (The "How")</h3>
          <p>
            Learners differ in how they navigate learning and express what they know.
            Some may need scaffolding, while others thrive with independence.

          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="principle">
          <h3>3. Multiple Means of Engagement (The "Why")</h3>
          <p>
            Learners differ in what motivates and engages them. To tap into all learners'
            interests and offer appropriate challenges, you need flexible options.

      <h2>How to Use the Learning Mode Toggle</h2>

      <div class="how-to-box">
        <p>
          The <strong>Learning Mode toggle</strong> in the site header is the most important
          feature of this hub. It allows you to customize your learning experience.
        </p>

        <h3>🎯 Guided Path</h3>
        <p>
          Choose this if you want to achieve <strong>proficiency</strong> using aids.
          You'll see drills that emphasize using rulers, templates, and guides to produce
          accurate, high-fidelity work. Perfect for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Meeting course requirements and deadlines</li>
          <li>Building confidence with support tools</li>
          <li>Producing technical drawings</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>✍️ Mastery Path</h3>
        <p>
          Choose this if you want to develop <strong>freehand mastery</strong>. You'll see
          drills that emphasize gestural sketching with minimal aids. Perfect for:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Rapid ideation and concept sketching</li>
          <li>Building muscle memory and intuition</li>
          <li>Developing expressive, confident line work</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="tip">
          💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> You can switch between modes at any time. Your selection
          is saved in your browser, so you don't have to choose every time you visit.

      <h2>How to Use the Mastery Rubrics</h2>

      <p>
        At the end of each module, you'll find a <strong>Mastery Rubric</strong>. This is a
        self-assessment tool to help you reflect on your progress.
      </p>

      <div class="rubric-levels">
        <div class="level">
          <h3>Novice</h3>
          <p>You're just starting. Struggles are normal and expected.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="level">
          <h3>Proficient</h3>
          <p>
            You can achieve the module's goals. The exact definition changes based on your
            Learning Mode (aided vs. freehand).
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="level">
          <h3>Mastery</h3>
          <p>
            You've internalized the skill and can apply it flexibly. Again, the definition
            adapts to your Learning Mode.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        <strong>Remember:</strong> These rubrics are for <em>you</em>. They're not graded by
        an instructor. Be honest with yourself, and use them to guide your practice.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Physical vs. Digital Modes</h2>

      <p>
        Each module includes tips for both <strong>physical</strong> (pen and paper) and
        <strong>digital</strong> (tablet and software) sketching.
      </p>

      <p>
        Both modes are equally valid. Choose based on your tools, preferences, and goals:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Physical:</strong> Tactile feedback, no technical barriers, traditional feel
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Digital:</strong> Undo/redo, layers, built-in perspective guides
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Many professional designers are fluent in both and switch depending on the task.
      </p>

    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <ol class="getting-started-steps">
        <li>
          <strong>Choose your Learning Mode</strong> using the toggle in the header
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Start with Module 1</strong> (Biomechanics & Line) to build foundations
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Work through each module</strong> at your own pace
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use the self-support sections</strong> when you get stuck
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Self-assess with rubrics</strong> to track your progress
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p class="encouragement">
        Remember: Everyone learns at their own pace. The goal is not perfection—it's
        <strong>progress</strong>. Use the tools that work for you, and don't be afraid to
        switch modes as you grow.
